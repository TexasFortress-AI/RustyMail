Update taskmaster appropriately, and add any memories as appropriate to your mycelian-memory to record any key insights / "ah-ha moments", important understandings, lessons learned, and decisions made (and the reasons why). Then proceed working your way through the tasks in taskmaster. Whenever making a decision, be sure to consult your mycelian-memory, as it will inform your decisions.
