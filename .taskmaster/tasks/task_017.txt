# Task ID: 17
# Title: Configure CI/CD pipeline
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 16
# Priority: medium
# Description: Set up continuous integration and deployment with automated testing and releases
# Details:
Configure GitHub Actions or similar CI/CD system. Set up automated testing on multiple Rust versions and platforms. Add security scanning and dependency vulnerability checks. Configure automated releases with proper versioning. Add Docker image building and container registry publishing.

# Test Strategy:
Test CI/CD pipeline with pull requests. Verify automated testing runs successfully. Test release automation and artifact publishing.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up CI/CD workflow configuration [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create and configure the main CI/CD workflow file using GitHub Actions or a similar system to orchestrate all pipeline steps.
### Details:
Define the workflow triggers (e.g., on push, pull request, or release), set up environment variables, and ensure the workflow file is placed in the correct directory (e.g., .github/workflows/ci.yml).

## 2. Implement automated testing across Rust versions and platforms [done]
### Dependencies: 17.1
### Description: Configure jobs to build and test the project on multiple Rust toolchains (stable, beta, nightly) and supported operating systems (Linux, macOS, Windows).
### Details:
Use a build matrix to run tests on all specified Rust versions and platforms. Ensure that failures in any matrix entry fail the overall job.

## 3. Integrate security scanning and dependency vulnerability checks [done]
### Dependencies: 17.1
### Description: Add steps to the workflow for automated security analysis and dependency vulnerability scanning.
### Details:
Use tools such as cargo-audit or third-party GitHub Actions to scan for known vulnerabilities in dependencies and report issues in the workflow output.

## 4. Configure automated releases with semantic versioning [done]
### Dependencies: 17.1, 17.2, 17.3
### Description: Set up workflow steps to automate versioning and release creation, including publishing release artifacts.
### Details:
Use release automation tools or GitHub Actions to increment versions, generate changelogs, and publish releases to the appropriate registry (e.g., crates.io).

## 5. Add Docker image build and container registry publishing [done]
### Dependencies: 17.1, 17.2, 17.3, 17.4
### Description: Extend the workflow to build Docker images and publish them to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub or GitHub Container Registry).
### Details:
Define Docker build steps, tag images with release versions, and authenticate with the target registry for publishing.
