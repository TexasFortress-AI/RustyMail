# Dependencies: 10
# Priority: medium
# Description: Build the React dashboard frontend and integrate with backend services
# Details:
Build the existing React frontend located in frontend/rustymail-app-main/ using Vite build system. Integrate built static files with Actix backend using actix-files middleware. Configure SSE EventSource connections for real-time updates. Implement stats display, client list, and configuration panels using existing React components.

# Test Strategy:
Test frontend build process. Verify static file serving from backend. Test real-time updates via SSE connection. Cross-browser compatibility testing.

# Subtasks:
