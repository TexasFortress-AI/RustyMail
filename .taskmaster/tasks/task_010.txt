# Task ID: 10
# Title: Implement dashboard backend services
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Complete dashboard backend with metrics, client management, and configuration services
# Details:
Complete metrics collection service using sysinfo crate. Implement client management service to track active connections and user agents. Add configuration service for runtime settings. Create SSE event broadcasting system for real-time updates. Implement system health monitoring.

# Test Strategy:
Test metrics collection accuracy and performance. Verify client tracking across different interfaces. Test SSE event broadcasting with multiple clients.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Complete Metrics Collection Service [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement a service to collect and expose system metrics using the sysinfo crate.
### Details:
Use the sysinfo crate to gather CPU, memory, and disk statistics. Ensure the service can periodically refresh and provide up-to-date metrics for the dashboard backend.

## 2. Implement Client Management Service [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a service to track active client connections and user agent information.
### Details:
Maintain a registry of connected clients, recording connection status and user agent strings. Provide APIs to query and manage client sessions.

## 3. Add Configuration Service for Runtime Settings [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a configuration management service to handle runtime settings for the dashboard backend.
### Details:
Allow dynamic retrieval and updating of configuration parameters without requiring service restarts. Support validation and persistence of settings.

## 4. Create SSE Event Broadcasting System [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement a Server-Sent Events (SSE) system for real-time event broadcasting to dashboard clients.
### Details:
Broadcast updates for metrics, client connections, and configuration changes. Ensure efficient event delivery and support for multiple concurrent clients.

## 5. Implement System Health Monitoring [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a health monitoring component to track and report the status of backend services and system resources.
### Details:
Monitor service uptime, resource usage, and error rates. Provide health check endpoints and integrate with alerting mechanisms if thresholds are breached.
